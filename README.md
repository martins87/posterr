# Strider Technical Assessment - Daniel Martins

## 1. Description

The application is a Twitter like social network where users can write text-only posts and follow other users to interact with their posts.

## 2. Project decisions

* Frontend library: React
* Styled components and icons: Material UI
* Users and posts are read from the testing API [{JSON} Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
* State-management solution: Zustand
* Your user (the test user) has the id 0 and is the starting state of the store, before fetching all the users from the API

## 3. Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Have Node.js and yarn installed

### Installing

Run in the project directory:

`yarn install`

`yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## 4. Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
* [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)

## 5. Planning

blank

## 6. Self-critique & scaling

### What I would improve if I had more time

* Overall application styling 
* Logic of feed of all / following pots
* Styling of toggle all / following
* Thread of comments on each post
* Number of likes of each post
* Feature of sharing other user's posts
* Feature of sharing some post to another social media
* Sort posts by date
* Add scroll to user profile page, to show all users posts and not only first three ones
* Url change for feed and user profile page
